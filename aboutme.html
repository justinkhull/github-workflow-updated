		<p>I grew up in this town, in fact I've never lived anywhere else. I am a graduate of the Academic Magnet High School
		Class of 2015. After graduation, I attended Winthrop University for 3 semesters (just long enough to realize that 
		I absolutely hated that place). From there, I transfered to the College of Charleston this January. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computing in the Arts with a concentration in Digital Media. Ideally, I would like to
		build a career in front-end web development in the Charleston Area. Outside of school, I work as a rowing coach for juniors with the 
		Charleston City Rowing Club.</p>
	
		<p>Here's a link to my graphic design portfolio that I created in CSCI 114 last semester: <a href="https://justinkhull.wixsite.com/portfolio">Wix Portfolio</a></p>
		
		<p>A few of my interests:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rock/Hard Rock/Metal Music (e.g. Motionless In White, Bring Me The Horizon, Marilyn Manson, and Slipknot</li>
				<li>Concerts (I've lost track of how many I've been to at this point...)</li>
				<li>Dogs. My dream dog is a German Shepherd/Husky mix. <a href="https://animalso.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/german-shepherd-husky-mix_4.jpg">Here</a> is a picture of one.</li>
				<li>Graphic Design. I'm very interested in logo design and Photoshop manipulation</li>
				<li>Horror Movies/Shows (American Horror Story...Need I say more?)</li>
				<li> Rowing, Rowing, Rowing</li>
			</ul>
